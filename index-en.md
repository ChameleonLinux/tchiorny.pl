# In the past...

Every minute of our spare time was devoted to the German Shepherds.
Black Russian Terriers didn't interest us then, although we had been seeing them many times at the exhibitions. It would have probably stayed that way till now if it wasn't for Sendi Big who came to our house by accident.
We had bought her from previous owner only because of our sensitive heart. It didn't even cross our mind that we will breed Black Russian Terriers ourselves. At that time we thought that no breed could be better than German Shepherd, as an utility dog and as a pet.

How wrong we could be !!!

We were charmed by Sendi’s character and natural beauty outright. We also found out very quickly that Black Terrier live up to all our expectations as utility and family dog. They  perfect and as quick as German Shepherds to teach and to train. They follow orders maybe a  bit slower than German Shepherds but more accurately. As a family dogs they are more affectionate, tender and they get on well with all members of the family. They are not aggressive towards other animals at home, they are also quiet (they bark very little), don't shed (very important for those who like to keep their house neat and tidy), take very little space (do not walk around the house without reason). They also have very important feature - they accomodate to their owners lifestyle.

So "black girl” has won our heart and we've decided to find out more about this breed. We have started looking for FCI standard and all literature feverishly. We were brought up on the reliable German Shepherd’s kynology, where the main attention is paid to the careful knowledge of  the pedigree - the most valuable source of information about the dog's exterier and the character, essential for breeding. We were collecting all available and not available documentiation and - most of all - the pedigrees themselves.

Sendi happend to be a great exhibition bitch. During her show carrier she obtained such titles like: International Champion, Polish Champion and Dendi Zabadak StarPolish Winner. She also obtained the title of Austrian Champion and Austrian Winner as the first Black Russian Terrier from Poland. She was a multi winner of shows in Poland, Denmark and Germany. Also our "blacky girl " happened to be a great breeding bitch. She gave only 12 puppies in her 3 litters, but three of them became International Champions, seven of them possessed certificates for Champions of Poland, Austria, Germany, Denmark and Russia. Sendi's children were always excellent during the shows. Four times they won the title of Club Winner  of Poland (1999, 2000) and of Slovakia (1999). They also possessed appointments to Champion of International BRT's Club as the first ones in Poland.

In end of 1996 six-year-old Dendi Zabadak Star came to our house. He became the most faithful friend and defender of our son. The titles of Interchampion, Champion of Poland, Czech, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Czech Club and Austrian Winner and Winner of Czech BRT's Club did not hinder him from being in friendship with the little boy.

# From some time now...

We can say with proud that Sendi Big is a founder of our kennel.

Our rule is that a bitches: Sendi, her daughters and soon even her granddaughters make the foundation of our kennel. We progress by mating them with the best quality, healthy and reproductor from Europe and from the country of the breed origin. While choosing partners for our bitches, we keep in mind, that puppies born in our kennel have elitare origin, unique in Poland. We consider to be important the feature of all utility dogs - the will to serve a man.

The Vandogs are succesful at agility, they complete obedience and IPO courses with no problems whatsover and work trials in Poland as well as abroad. With successes they are starting in various competitions.

On beginning 2001 came to us from Russia little girl named Hohloma Boyaryna. Borgia - because so we called her - is Igor's Van Dog and multichampion Royal Rechel's iz Rayvola Nord daughter. Her breeder is Mrs. Tatiana Issaeva - owner of Nord Praid Kennel from Sankt Petersbourg, Russia.

But the most important quality of Van Dog BRT is that they make loving and loyal members of every family.


# Today...

We can proudly say that Black Terriers from our kennel were the first ones in Poland to become Champions of Russia, Lithuania, Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Luxembourg, Czech and Slovakia. They also acceded to the  Champion titles of France, Netherlands, USA, Germany, Denmark, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia. Black Terriers born in our kennel found lovely families and sweet homes in Russia, Croatia, Belgium, Denmark, USA, France, Georgia, Libya, South Africa, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, to name a few.

We're glad to see that children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of our offspring actively participate in breeding programs of Black Terrier all around the world. Especially, they received recognition by Russian BRT breeders who appreciated our work and used dogs from our kennel in their breeding program.
We learn continuously about our breed, and discover more and more new secrets of BRT's soul...
